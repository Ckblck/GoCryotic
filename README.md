# GoCryotic

> **NOTE:** This is a **WIP** for the not yet released replay-system **Cryotic**.
> 
## Project

**GoCryotic** was made to fulfill the requirements of storing a replay remotely, allowing then to be accessed from all over a network. It also keeps track of the replays in which the player has participated.

All of these is managed by the plugin itself, [Cryotic](https://github.com/Ckblck/Cryotic).

## API Documentation
You can visit the [API Documentation](https://ckblck.github.io/GoCryotic/index.html) which explains how are the requests done, and what responses do they send.

## Releases

A release will be published when the project is completed.
